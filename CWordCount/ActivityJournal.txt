SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:Takumi Fukuzawa

===========================================================
Start: 
Estimated time: 2 hours
Plan: write pseudocode, then figure out the syntax for C.
Figure out how to do word count because it seems hard to do with random spaces/enters. Also understand getchar a bit better so I can use  it properly before  starting.

Complete
Actual time: Roughly 2 hours
Observations:
It took a bit of research and stuff to understand the whole 
deal with using  the < text thing. Also ran into a logic error
where i was using a or when i should've been using an and 
so that wasted sosme time. But i learned a lot from from this program!
