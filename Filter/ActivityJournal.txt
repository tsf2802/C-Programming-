SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Takumi Fukuzawa

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	4hr 30min
Plan:
-read lectures for malloc and free. Work more with pointers  to 
use them better. After doing so, beacuse of the similarities to the find
program take a look at find program to complete this program.


Complete
Actual Time	7hr
Observations:
It took a few days of relaxing to be able to give all my effort into coding.
I was super burnt out and every time I tried  to code and ran into a issue
i ended up quitting instead of figuiring out the progblem. The programming
was a great excersise for working with pointers and I feel like I got a
good understanding, but being burnt out was the biggest obstacle.
