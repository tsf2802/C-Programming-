SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Takumi Fukuzawa

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	3 Hr 
Plan:
Start with the make file. Look back at the zoom lecture
and look at the make file presentation.
From there, understand pointers through the pointers/arrays
presentation and then write pseudocode, then write the program.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time 4Hr 30 
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Surprisingly, the .h  file took the longest to figure out because
despite understanding how pointers worked, I couldn't get the parameters 
right for the .h file until i realised they also needed 
to mimic the .c file parameters nearly identically. Otherwise
writing the actual loop for getchar was very easy.
