Start
Estimated Time	4 Hr
Plan:
Mess around with pointers to understand how they work better. 
For each method as they are similar try to see if you can use previous methods
while writing current methods.

Complete
Actual Time	5Hr
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
This program was hard because of the syntax of pointers. I knew 
what i wanted to do with the pointers but had trouble coding those ideas.
Furthermore, I got overwhelemd with other work I couldn't focus on this
program really until the weekend. Learned a lot about pointers for this program
but really need to catch up.
