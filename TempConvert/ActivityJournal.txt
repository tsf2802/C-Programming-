SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Takumi Fukuzawa

================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time: 3 Hours
Plan: 
Figure out the C language a bit
write code similar to java, and attempt to run
Start tweaking the code to follow c rules instead of java
try running until it finally works.
Will be rough to learn C but will keep trying my best.

Complete
Actual Time: roughly 4 hours?
Observations: The Nitron commands and typing in C and writing code in C proved to be wayyyy harder than I could've imagined. It doesn't help that I have a 60% keyboard. Afte accessing putty through my laptop coding became much easier because of the keyboard.
===============================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time: 2 Hours
Plan: 
copy the file, I read how to do this somewhere to it should be ok
then do some research on how to do float variables 
Once i understand the properties of float variables I will attempt to midify the code
For testing, I will keep tweaking it until I get the results I want

Complete
Actual Time:30 minutes
Observations:It really should have only taken 5 minutes, but being new to Putty I totally forgot to recompile my code with the gcc command! Well, It took quite long to figure out why my program kept not working when I knew the code was right but otherwise this part was super easy.
