# C-Programming-
Assignments for my C Programming Classes.

CProgrammingActivity, hw2, in-class-1 and in-class2 all are projects that utilized a Nucleo STM microcontroller.
We learned things like:
Handlers, Polling, Busy-wait, Interrupts

The rest of the folders are small projects that helped me learn the foundations of C like pointers, malloc and freeing memory.
